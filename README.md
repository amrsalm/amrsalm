### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm engrossed in a project focused on creating a deep learning-based Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) model for urolithiasis. This endeavor is not just about predictive analytics; it's about paving the way for personalized medicine and tailored healthcare interventions.

My previous experiences include developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to bridge the gap between disparate biomedical ontologies, such as linking ICD codes to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. This work is crucial for enhancing the interoperability of medical data and fostering a more integrated approach to patient care.

If you're on a similar journey, or if the realms of machine learning, genomics, and data science excite you, let's connect!
