### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» **Current Project:** Iâ€™m working on a deep learning-based **Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) model** for urolithiasis. This project combines machine learning and genomics to make strides in personalized medicine, helping to create tailored healthcare solutions.

ðŸ“ˆ **Natural History Analysis:** As part of my research, Iâ€™m studying the **natural history of kidney stone disease** to uncover how genetic and environmental factors interact over time. This work aids in understanding disease progression, informing preventative strategies, and refining treatment plans.

ðŸ§¬ **NLP in Biomedical Data:** Iâ€™ve developed an **NLP model** that links ICD codes to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, bridging gaps between different biomedical data standards. This project improves medical data interoperability, supporting a more integrated approach to patient care.

ðŸš€ If youâ€™re interested in **machine learning, genomics, or data science**, letâ€™s connect!
